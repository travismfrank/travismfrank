### Hi, I'm Travis 👋
I found organizations, design systems, and conduct orchestras.

🏢 - I'm currently at [Prospero](https://prosperoapp.com), building scheduling software for theatrical production teams.

🔭 - I'm the builder & maintainer of [HyperDurable](https://github.com/ticket-bridge/hyper-durable), an abstraction for [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/durable-objects/) to enable natural, object-like access to underlying persistent storage. Like RPC, for Durable Objects. I am also a founding contributor of [Obsidian](https://github.com/open-source-labs/obsidian), Deno's first native GraphQL caching layer.

🎓 - I'm a lifelong student, and you can learn with me by following [my writing](http://www.travismfrank.com/).

🎹 - I wrote musicals and conducted orchestras before COVID, and I still enjoy writing and playing with my partner.

📫 - You can reach me at travis@travismfrank.com.
